# World-Invasion
![alt text](https://github.com/MathewKouch/World-Invasion/blob/main/world_invasion/home.png)

A modification of the classic Space Invaders where you defend a completely blue planet from an armada of alien fleets. 

I built this game to learn python, pygame and game development with the guide of ERIC MATTHES 
book Python Crash Course: A hands-on, project based Introduction to Programming.
