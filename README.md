# World-Invasion
A classic Space Invaders game where you defend a completely blue planet from an armada of alien fleets. 
I built this game to learn python, pygame and game development.

*** DISCLAIMER***
Built with the guide of ERIC MATTHES book Python Crash Course: A hands-on, project based Introduction to Programming.
Credit goes to him for most of the code.
